    "## Objective:\n",
    "Write a Python script that spawns `W` workers (processes or threads). Each worker must first generate a sequence of `N` random values obtained from a specified statistical distribution, which should be considered as inter-event time intervals. After each interval, the worker must write the current timestamp (with millisecond precision) to an output file. When the all workers terminate, the script must read the output file and compute the average inter-event time based on the recorded timestamps. The average value must be computed both overall and separately for each worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the [numpy library](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/legacy.html) to generate random samples from a given distribution. For instance, `np.random.exponential(1 / LAMBA, size=SIZE)` generates a ramdom numpy array of `SIZE` values sampled from an exponential distribution with rate parameter `LAMBDA`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Command line arguments:\n",
    "The script must allow these inputs from the command line:\n",
    "   - Number of workers to generate\n",
    "   - Number of inter-event intervals to generate\n",
    "   - Distribution of the inter-event time and related parameter(s), including at least:\n",
    "       * deterministic (parameter: fixed inter-event time)\n",
    "       * uniform within an interval `[0:T]` (parameter: size of the interval)\n",
    "       * exponential (parameter: mean event occurrence rate)\n",
    "   - Name of the file to write the timestamps in\n",
    "   - Choice between sequential, multithreading or multiprocessing\n"
