    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "Let's build our first Kubernetes application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps:\n",
    "1. Modify the code of the REST HTTP server so that now it will read some \"preconfigured\" resources from some file JSON file at boot. You can chose the location (e.g., /etc/my_res.json) and the internal structure of this file;\n",
    "2. Re-build and ship the new version of the cointainer image;\n",
    "3. Write the YAML files needed to deploy the HTTP server in the k0s cluster(i.e., one deployment file, one service file, and one ConfigMap file containing two \"preconfigured\" resources);\n",
    "4. Deploy the application!;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### N.B. \n",
    "If you don't want to create a public account on Docker Hub you can run your local registry. You can find the container image for the registry [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/registry). Since the registry itsef it's a container you can run it inside your Kubernetes cluster and expose its port to upload your container image there.\n",
