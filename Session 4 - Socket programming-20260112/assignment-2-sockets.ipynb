    "# Assignment 2: Socket programming\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "Write a Python script that opens a stream socket server listening on a given TCP port. For each new incoming connection, the server must store in a list the time elapsed since the previous connection setup (using at least millisecond precision). Then the server must store in another list the time elapsed since the previous data reception on that connection (again using at least millisecond precision). If a `--verbose` option is passed, the server must also print out the content of any data received from a client, decoded in text format. Before terminating, the server must print out the average inter-arrival time computed from both stored lists (connection setup time and data reception time). Tests must be run for both iterative and concurrent server modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a client script, you can reuse the script developed in Assignment 1 (timestamp generator with different inter-event time distributions) after properly modifying it to send the timestamps through the stream socket instead of writing them to an output file. Also the client should print out the generated timestamps only if a `--verbose` option is passed. The client must always run in a multithreading concurrency mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Command line arguments:\n",
    "The server-side script must allow these inputs from the command line:\n",
    "   - Server's IP address or hostname (optional, with a specified default value)\n",
    "   - Server's TCP port number (optional, with a specified default value)\n",
    "   - Choice between iterative and concurrent server mode (optional, with a specified default value)\n",
    "   - Verbose mode (optional, disabled by default)\n",
    "\n",
    "The client-side script must allow these inputs from the command line:\n",
    "   - Number of workers to generate\n",
    "   - Number of inter-event intervals to generate\n",
    "   - Distribution of the inter-event time and related parameter(s), including at least:\n",
    "       * deterministic (parameter: fixed inter-event time)\n",
    "       * uniform within an interval `[0:T]` (parameter: size of the interval)\n",
    "       * exponential (parameter: mean event occurrence rate)\n",
    "   - Server's IP address or hostname to send the timestamps to (required)\n",
    "   - Server's TCP port number (optional, with a specified default value)\n",
    "   - Verbose mode (optional, disabled by default)\n",
