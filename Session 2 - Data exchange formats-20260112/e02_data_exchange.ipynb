    "### Objective:\n",
    "The objective of this exercise is to create a command-line tool that retrieves JSON data from a remote source, filters it based on user ID, stores the filtered data locally in YAML format, and allows the user to add new TODO items to the local copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "1. **Command-line Interface (CLI) Arguments Parsing**:\n",
    "   - Parse the following arguments from the command line interface:\n",
    "     - Remote endpoint URL (string, optional, default 'https://dummyjson.com/todos')\n",
    "     - User ID (integer, optional, default 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retrieve Remote Data**:\n",
    "   - Fetch JSON data from the specified remote endpoint URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Filter Data by User ID**:\n",
    "   - Filter the retrieved JSON data to keep only TODOs related to the specified user ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Print Filtered Data**:\n",
    "   - Print the filtered data to the console for the user to review.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Save Filtered Data Locally**:\n",
    "   - Save the filtered data locally as a YAML file.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **User Interaction**:\n",
    "   - Prompt the user to insert a new TODO item [check input()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input).\n",
    "      - Ask for a description of the new TODO.\n",
    "   - Generate a unique TODO ID for it.\n",
    "   - Save the new TODO item to the local file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Notes:\n",
    "- Ensure proper error handling for network requests and file operations.\n",
    "- Validate user inputs, such as ensuring the user ID is an integer.\n",
    "- Implement user-friendly messages and prompts to guide the user through the interaction process.\n",
    "- (optional) Consider modularizing the code into functions for better readability and maintainability.\n",
    "- (optional) Document the code with comments or docstrings to explain its functionality and usage.\n"
